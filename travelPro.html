            <h3>How To Get To The Giza Pyramids</h3>
            <p style="font-size: 7;">
                    The nearest airport is the Cairo International Airport (CAI), which is served by a bunch of international airlines. You can shop for flights to Cairo at Skyscanner.

                    From the Cairo airport, its a 1 hour drive to Giza. The arrivals zone has plenty of taxis you can take, but I used Uber and I would highly recommend this because it s much cheaper and probably safer too.

                    Do not rent a car in Egypt unless you are familiar with driving in the Middle East! Traffic in Arab countries is dangerous and chaotic, and you ll be much better off going
